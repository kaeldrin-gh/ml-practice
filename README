# ML Learning

This repo tracks my transition from **Data Analytics → ML/AI Research**.  
It contains step-by-step practice projects using **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and PyTorch**.

---

## Structure
- `scikit-learn/` → classical ML (pipelines, CV, feature importance)  
- `tensorflow-keras/` → deep learning (CNNs, callbacks, tf.data)  
- `pytorch/` → custom loops, datasets, model building  
- `utils/` → reusable helper functions (plotting, metrics, etc.)  

---

## Completed Projects
- [x] Iris classification with Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- [ ] Titanic survival prediction (Scikit-learn pipeline + CV)
- [ ] Fashion-MNIST classifier (Keras MLP + ConvNet)
- [ ] PyTorch MNIST baseline (MLP)
- [ ] PyTorch vs Keras comparison (CIFAR-10)

---

## Goal
To build hands-on experience with:
- **Scikit-learn** for tabular ML
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for fast prototyping
- **PyTorch** for research flexibility

Each project will include:
- Clean, reproducible code
- Metrics + plots
- Short markdown report of results
