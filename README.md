# ML Practice

A personal collection of machine learning and deep learning notebooks and scripts used for study, learning, practice, and experimentation.

I am still polishing my old notebooks and will upload them here gradually.

## Contents

- `scikit-learn/` — Classical ML: pipelines, cross-validation, feature engineering, and importance.
- `tensorflow-keras/` — TensorFlow / Keras experiments: CNNs, tf.data pipelines, callbacks, and training utilities.
- `transformers/` — Transformers examples: fine-tuning, generating comparison, paramaters handling.
